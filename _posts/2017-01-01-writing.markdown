New Years' is always a time for reflection on the year that has passed, and the year to come. 

While I'm not one for resolutions - ene thing I'd like to do this year is to write more, because I think the act of putting pen to paper (as it were) forces you to think through ideas and beliefs that might otherwise be ill-considered. 

The easiest and cheapest way to get a blog up and running seems to be GitHub pages, so that's what I've just set up.

Okay, enough talk, here's some amazing code (to test markup):

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
}

#=> prints 'Hello World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
